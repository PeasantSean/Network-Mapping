# Network-Mapping

<br>

### Overview
This project focuses on learning and practicing network mapping techniques using tools like nmap to scan and discover devices on local and remote networks. The goal is to better understand network structures, security, and device interactions, with practical applications in network security and network administration.

### Project Goals
- Learn and apply basic network mapping concepts.

- Understand and use tools like nmap for network discovery.

- Develop a deeper understanding of IP addresses, subnets, and network protocols.

- Document the process of setting up, running, and analyzing network scans.

### Technologies Used
**nmap:** Network discovery and security auditing tool.

**VMs (Virtual Machines):** To simulate isolated environments and different network configurations.

**Linux (Ubuntu):** For running network scans and testing configurations.

**Bridged & NAT Network Settings:** To understand the differences in network configurations and how they affect network scans.

**GitHub:** To document progress, track issues, and maintain code.

### Future Work
- **Expand nmap usage** – Test advanced scanning techniques, including OS fingerprinting (-O), service detection (-sV), and aggressive mode (-A).

- **Build a controlled home lab** – Set up multiple VMs with different network roles for structured network testing.

- **Explore security implications** – Identify open ports, misconfigurations, and possible vulnerabilities in a test environment.

- **Document findings and create visualizations** – Use tools like Zenmap or scripting to generate reports.
